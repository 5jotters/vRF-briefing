1.  **START-UP**

All participants will start up engines stick to each type of aircraft normal procedures. Normally will use this radio setting procedure for taxi, departure, GCI and also interflight COMMS:

● TWR: Will set UHF #15 with NELLIS TWR Freq to use. Once in cockpit we set manual Freq 327.000 UHF/132.550 VHF for ATC control.

● Interflight: VHF #X showing in CommCard and Mission Brief for each formation.

All formations will request weather info and departure data on ATIS: 270.100 and tower freq 327.000 UHF/ 132.550 VHF.

1.  **TAXI**

Once formation ready and within taxi times assigned it will be asked to TWR controller for taxing to runway in use. It one formation with problems at start up then following formation will ask for taxing to holding point of runway in use in order to avoid taxi collapsing.

When leader starts taxing will communicate in interflight freq: "Spartan 1, taxing RWY 05R, QNH 29,90". All wingmen will acknowledge: "Spartan 2, QNH 29,90".

All formations will hold the active arming zone waiting their respective take off times.

2.  **DEPARTURE**

Once formations cleared for departure will enter and take off depending on Airfield weather conditions. (DREAM ONE DEPARTURE)

● VMC: Take Off will be 1+1 at 10" spacing with visual rejoin when airborne. Afterwards will proceed to first route waypoint. This one will be exactly the same for all players in the package.

● IMC: Take Off will be 1+1 at 20" spacing. Wingman will maintain 2 NM trail formation till rejoin in VMC above clouds.

When Take Off procedure complete and airborne, TWR controller will clear the formations to change to Boom Freq. (Take Care, no human controller at this time, will use DCS normal fuel request and refueling procedure).
